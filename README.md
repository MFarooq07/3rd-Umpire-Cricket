# 3rd Umpire Cricket

<img src="umpire.jpeg" width=400>

Tired of resolving street cricket disputes over each and every decision doubting that the umpire is biased towards either of the teams? Then you are just in the right place!!!

Here we are trying to make a free home based system to resolve run-outs, stumps and leg before wicket (LBW) decisions over which the friends can get into fights and cause delay in matches, leaving them incompleted.

## What does this 3rd umpire system achieve and help us resolve?

* Providing ball tracking for LBWs
* Automatically providing an 'OUT' or 'NOT OUT' decision for a stump or run out decision
